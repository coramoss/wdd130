    <h2>Cora Mae Moss</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Cora, my middle name is Mae and I grew up being called Cora Mae, and also Cora, so either works fine! I'm from Houston, Texas, but live in Rexburg until my husband graduates and (hopefully) finds a job!</p>
    <p>On that note, I've been married for a little over two years and have a 5 month old little girl. She sure is a handful, and we love her so much!</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing an associates degree in Web Design/Web Development. I was doing photography with and emphasis of Web Design, but I would need to attend on campus and that is just not feasible with my daughter. So, I have a little photography business that I just started up so I can continue to pursue that dream of mine!</p>
    <p>I've been a member my whole life. But, I feel like I didn't have a testimony until I was about 17, so 3 years ago. I guess I always felt the church was true, which is why I kept going, but I never KNEW, or believed, really. I'm grateful for the knowledge that I have now, though. I think one thing that has been popping into my mind recently is that I (and you) are not alone, God loves me (and you) and He can give me (and you) greater capacity to do what I feel is right, but feel like I "can't" do.</p>
    <p>I'm really excited to be in this class, but also have feelings of inadequacy. But, I am excited to get to know you all and learn more!</p>
